[iktinos](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ictinus) is a tool that, using pure clojure data (.edn), you can architect an entire static website.

## Use-Case

What iktinos is good for:
* Personal websites
* Personal portfolio websites
* Personal blogs
* Anything static. (Completely static)

What iktinos is not good for:
* Anything dynamic
* I repeat, anything with substantial interactivity will not fly
